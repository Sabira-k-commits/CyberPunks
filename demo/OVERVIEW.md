# Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Name
CyberPunk

## 🚀 Summary
CyberPunk is a every-indivual-focused cybersecurity learning platform that combines **interactive games** with **secure authentication** and **admin oversight**.  
Users can learn to protect themselves online by playing challenges such as **Phishing Detection**, **Strong Password Creation**, and **Daily Quizzes**.  
The app emphasizes safety through **role-based access controls, MFA, brute-force prevention, and activity monitoring**.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🎮 **Interactive Games**: Learn through phishing challenges, password challenges, and quizzes.  
- 🛡 **User Verification**: Admin approval required before accessing games.  
- 🔑 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Added layer of security for all accounts.  
- 👨‍💻 **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for students, admins, and super admins.  
- 📊 **Leaderboard**: Encourages good security practices (e.g., enabling MFA, updating passwords) by awarding points.  
- 📜 **Activity Monitoring**: Logs of user actions like logins, password resets, and account changes.  
- 🚫 **Brute-Force Prevention**: Rate limiting on login attempts and account lockouts after multiple failed tries.  
- 📧 **Email Notifications**: For account verification, status updates, and security alerts.
- Password hashing in the database 

## 💡 Inspiration
The project was inspired by the growing need for **cybersecurity awareness**.  
Many people fall victim to **phishing attacks, weak passwords, and unsafe practices** due to lack of training.  
By making security education **interactive and game-like**, CyberPunk provides both **learning** and **engagement**, while ensuring the platform itself follows **best security practices**.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- 🌐 Add **more games and challenges** (e.g., Social Engineering simulation, Ransomware awareness).  
- 📱 Develop a **mobile app version** for wider accessibility.  
- 🧠 Implement **AI-powered phishing simulations** for more realistic challenges.  
- 🔔 Add **real-time push notifications** for account activity and new game challenges.  
- 🥇 Introduce **team-based leaderboards** for group competitions.
